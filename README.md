### Bryan Wang

Hello! It's a pleasure meeting you. My name is Bryan Wang, and I am a computer science student at the University of Waterloo. As an aspiring software developer, I set my eyes to the frontiers of computer science, especially in the fields of AI and machine learning. On the side, I like working on compilers for esolangs!

I also fill my time with some less academic pursuits such as piano, photography, cycling, philosophy, etc. It's an ever fluctuating list as I decide on who I wish to become, and what virtues I seek to cultivate. I know it must seem odd for someone pursuing computer science to dedicate so much to the humanities. But to me, the latter is what will make computer science's designs useful to the world. Isn't that what I ultimately wish to do?

Currently Working On:
* Using NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies to teach my AI how to play Snake (and hopefully Flappy Bird in the future!)
* A compiler for a Chinese programming langauge that compiles to MIPS assembly.
* Learning TensorFlow; I made good progress, but it'll be interesting to fully take advantage of the library.
* Maintaining the Text-to-Speech Highlighter Chrome extension.
* Updating my personal website with new photos!

Planned:
* A compiler for the esolang Piet.
* Simulate firefly synchronization using my boids project.
* Update this README :P

Tech Stack:
* Languages: Java, C/C++, Python, ARM, MIPS, Bash, Racket 
* Tools: AWS, Azure, Linux, MySQL, Git/GitHub, Terraform, Vim, VSCode, Jira
* Knowledgeable: JavaScript, HTML/CSS
